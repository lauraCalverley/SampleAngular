This is a sample of my code used in a CRM (Customer Relational Management) Web Application. This is code is not meant to work as is, but just to be a representation of my coding practices.

This application was written using HTML, CSS, AngularJs, Angular Material Design and integrates via API with a PHP backend written using the Laravel Framework.
